# Tiles-of-Arenas-WWDC23-submission
What I submitted for WWDC 23 Swift Student Challenge. 

Based on a JavaScript game I wrote a few years ago: https://github.com/Vince14Genius/Tiles-of-Arenas

- This is the code that I submitted to the Challenge **as is**. It does not contain any of the subsequent updates or fixes.

  - The continuously maintained version is in this repo: https://github.com/Vince14Genius/Tiles-of-Arenas-SwiftUI

- Although I did try to make the code as clean as possible, messy/spaghetti code can occasionally be spotted here and there because of the rushed nature of this project.
